# One-Cheque-for-Salary-Small-Business-
This is a very simple C program which uses file handling to create a notepad(to be printed) , which should be submitted with your total amount cheque and bank will pay the entered amount to every employee . It seems to be useful in small business owner (who don't use netbanking for some reason) for cashless transactions and payment to employee.

All you need to do is Change "User" by Your Name , change "YourAccountNo." by your account number, And change "Employee#" by Employee Name and "AccountOfEmpl#" to Account number of that employee
